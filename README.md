# Pinecone Sample Apps

This repository is a collection of sample applications that you can create and run locally to get hands-on with Pinecone vector databases and common AI patterns, tools and algorithms.

To interact with these sample apps without creating and running them locally, you can view them on the Docs site [here](https://docs.pinecone.io/examples/sample-apps).

## Getting started

Each top level folder is it's own sample app with a README.md file and instructions.

## We love feedback! 

As you work through these examples, if you encounter any problems or things that are confusing or don't work quite right, please [open a new issue :octocat:](https://github.com/pinecone-io/sample-apps/issues/new/choose).
